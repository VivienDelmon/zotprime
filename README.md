# Zotero Prime - On-premise Zotero platform

Zotero Prime is a full packaged repository aimed to make on-premise [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) deployment easier with the last versions of both Zotero client and server. This is the result of sleepness nights spent to deploy Zotero within my organization on a disconnected network. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you did not managed to use it.
